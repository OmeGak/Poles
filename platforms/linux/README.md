=============
The SDL2 packages for Ubuntu 12.04 are provided for convenience since only the old 1.2 version of the framework is available from the official repositories. Just install them throught your package manager as usual.

You can compile SDL2 yourself running the following commands from a terminal in the `SDL2-2.0.0` folder:

1. `./configure`.
2. `make`.
3. `sudo make install`.

For Artemis-Cpp we provide a compiled version (Ubuntu 12.04 again) of the framework linked to the NetBeans' project.

You can compile Artemis-Cpp your self by running the following commands from a terminal in the `Artemis-Cpp` folder:

1. `make`.
2. `sudo make install`.
