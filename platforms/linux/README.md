Linux
=============
The SDL2 packages for Ubuntu 12.04 are provided for convenience since only the old 1.2 version of the framework is available from the official repositories. Just install them throught your package manager as usual.

For Artemis-Cpp we provide a compiled version (Ubuntu 12.04 again) of the framework linked to the NetBeans' project. You can compile the framework yourself by running the `make` command inside the Artemis-Cpp folder.
